Get in touch
============

We are glad you want to get in touch!

If you want to send a proposal, please read the :doc:`contributing
<contributing>` section first, it will make your life easier.

You can get in touch with us in different ways:

- you can send an email to interop-dev@lists.funkfeuer.at
- you can subscribe to the `interop-dev mailing list
  <https://lists.funkfeuer.at/mailman/listinfo/interop-dev>`_
- you can reach us via `github <https://github.com/netjson/netjson>`_

We prefer the mailing list to discuss but we also like to keep track of
proposals on github.

You may also want to read the `interop-dev archives
<https://lists.funkfeuer.at/pipermail/interop-dev/>`_ to read past
discussions.
